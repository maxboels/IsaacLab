## Key Notes:

1. **Joint Names**: You need to adjust the joint names in the config to match your URDF/USD file. Look for:
   - Rear wheel joints (drive)
   - Front steering joints
   - Front wheel joints (passive rolling)

2. **USD File**: Place your converted USD file at:

isaac_lab/source/isaaclab_tasks/isaaclab_tasks/direct/quantum_tracer/assets/quantum_tracer.usd
